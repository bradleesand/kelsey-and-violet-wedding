# Detailed Guide to Critical Northwest

This guide is designed to help first-time attendees prepare for Critical Northwest. For information about our ceremony at Critical Northwest, please refer to the [ceremony details page](./index.html). For our default world reception, RSVP, and other details, please visit our [main wedding website](https://withjoy.com/kelsey-and-violet).

## What is Critical Northwest?

Critical Northwest (CNW) is a week-long participatory camping event inspired by Burning Man. Unlike music festivals or typical camping trips, CNW is built around community participation, self-expression, and radical self-reliance. There are no vendors or scheduled entertainment - everything is created by the participants (including you!).

The 2025 theme is "Community Garden" which celebrates creative expression, art, and community.

**Key things to understand:**
- It's not a festival where you're a spectator - everyone contributes in some way
- There's no buying or selling (except ice) - everything operates on a gifting economy
- You need to bring everything you need to survive (food, water, shelter)
- It's a Leave No Trace event - you pack out everything you bring in

## First-Timer Preparation Checklist

- [ ] Plan your transportation to/from the event. Parking passes are required to park onsite, available for purchase during the Main Sale, and are limited.

## Camping Options
Please note that Gravity Well is currently full for camping. If you are not already part of a theme camp, you should plan to camp in the open camping area, which is the general camping area for individuals not affiliated with a theme camp.

If you do have connections with another theme camp, you might be able to join them, but most theme camps plan their space allocation well in advance.

## On-Site Services

- **ThunderCarts:** Transportation assistance if you need help getting around
- **Rangers:** Safety personnel (look for khaki pants/green shirts) - they can help with problems
- **Medical:** First aid services available 24/7
- **Water:** There is often potable water on site, but it is not guaranteed and is subject to the Masons' discretion. We strongly recommend bringing all the water that you will need for the entire week (drinking, cooking, cleaning)
- **Ice:** Available for purchase at the HUB
- **Portas:** Portable toilets (they usually have toilet paper and are cleaned daily, but bring some one-ply just in case they run out)

## Important Rules
- **Quiet Hours:** Midnight to 8 AM (except in designated sound areas)
- **No Driving:** After 8 PM
- **River Safety:** Use buddy system, no water entry between dusk and dawn
